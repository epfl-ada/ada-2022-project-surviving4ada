          Wikispeedia is a path game, which makes it possible to study the access distance from
          transport hubs to other articles. We conducted a causal analysis of the average 
          shortest distance from the starting article to the destination. Noting that the 
          coefficient of the fitted linear regression model possess a small p-value, it is
          reasonable to believe that the transport hub makes the game less difficult and 
          they have a higher throughput rate.

          Playersâ€™ behaviour leads to the creation of these transport hubs, and our findings suggest that people's subconscious tendency to choose does bring them closer to their destination.
          <br><br>
          What makes people choose these transport hubs? What do these transport hubs have in common? Do they all contain richer semantic information? Or what happened in real life to cause them to be more easily recalled?
